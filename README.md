- 👋 Hi, I’m @errantcanadian / Trystan Goetze.
- 🤷 I take any pronouns, but most often he/him or they/them.
- 🦉 I have a Ph.D. in Philosophy and currently work as a Postdoctoral Fellow at Harvard University.
- 🧑‍🏫 My teaching is focused on the ethics of computing, artificial intelligence, and the tech industry. At Harvard, I work in an interdisciplinary teaching lab to design ethics lessons that are integrated into computer science courses. You can find more information about that [here](https://embeddedethics.seas.harvard.edu/).
- 📝 My research is on computer ethics, moral and epistemic responsibility, and epistemic injustice. You can learn more [here](https://philpeople.org/profiles/trystan-s-goetze).
- 👀 I’m interested in problems that can best be solved by combining expertise across computer science and philosophy.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Python, Java, JavaScript, [GB Studio](https://chrismaltby.itch.io/gb-studio), and [Ink](https://github.com/inkle).
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on computer ethics teaching initiatives.
